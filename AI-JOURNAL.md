# Ultra_AI — AI Journal

> This file is the continuity log for AI assistants (Claude Code, Claude.ai) working on Dylan's Ultra_AI project.
> Each entry documents what happened, what changed, and what the next AI session should know.
> The dashboard also has an "AI Journal" tab where entries are stored in the app state and synced via GitHub Gist.

## How This Works

1. **Dashboard AI Journal tab** — Interactive entries stored in app state (synced to Gist)
2. **This MD file** — Long-form context for Claude Code sessions (stored in the GitHub repo)
3. **Both should be kept in sync** — When Claude Code makes changes, it should update both

## Project Overview

**Owner:** Dylan, CEO of FortX Web (Quebec-based web dev agency)
**Goal:** Build a fully autonomous AI-powered web agency in 60 days
**Method:** Ultralearning framework (80% build / 20% learn)
**Dashboard:** GitHub Pages site with GitHub Gist cloud sync for state

### The 60-Step Plan (Revised)

- **Phase 0 (Steps 1-5 + X):** Metalearning — map skills, test tools, set benchmarks, build news digest
- **Phase 1 (Steps 6-20):** Build Faster — AI websites, SOPs, first automations, client delivery
- **Phase 2 (Steps 21-40):** Lead Gen + Outreach — email pipeline, voice AI, campaign optimization
- **Phase 3 (Steps 41-60):** Autonomy + Mastery — full system, hardening, 4-hour agency drill

### Key Principles

- **Tool-agnostic:** Steps describe skills, not specific tools. Dylan picks tools during execution.
- **Progressive stacking:** Each step's output feeds the next
- **Drills (🔁):** Rebuild without notes to prove mastery
- **"Done =":** Every step has a concrete completion definition
- **No filler:** Every step involves AI tools, prompting, or automation

### Tech Stack (as chosen by Dylan — update as he picks tools)

- **AI Website Builder:** TBD (testing in Step 3)
- **Automation Platform:** TBD (testing in Step 4)
- **Lead Sourcing:** TBD (testing in Step 23)
- **Cold Email:** TBD (testing in Step 26)
- **AI Voice:** TBD (testing in Step 34)
- **Dashboard:** GitHub Pages + GitHub Gist sync

## Entry Log

### 2025-02-27 — Project Setup (AI: Claude.ai)

**What happened:**
- Rewrote the entire 60-step plan based on Ultralearning book principles
- Old plan had tool-locked steps, passive learning, poor progression, no retrieval practice
- New plan: 80% build / 20% learn, drills every 4-5 steps, tool-agnostic, "Done =" on every step
- Added Step X (mini project: AI news digest) to Phase 0
- Built complete dashboard v2 with: Skill Tree tab, AI Journal tab, GitHub Gist cloud sync, step notes, auto-timestamps, search/filter, keyboard shortcuts, celebrations, pipeline tooltips

**What changed from original:**
- 60 steps completely rewritten (was tool-locked, now skill-focused)
- Phase 0 expanded from 3 to 6 steps (proper metalearning)
- Phase 2 reorganized: email first, voice second (was mixed)
- "Train VA on SOPs" removed (not an AI skill)
- 11 learning steps (📚) added explicitly (~18%)
- 4 drills added (speed runs, memory rebuilds, 4-hour agency)
- Skill Tree stored in dashboard (not Notion) per Dylan's request

**What the next AI should know:**
- Dylan is a COMPLETE beginner with GitHub — he's learning it in Step 1
- The dashboard is a single HTML file (no build tools, no dependencies)
- All state is in localStorage + GitHub Gist (JSON)
- The Gist stores: step statuses, pipeline states, notes, timestamps, skill tree, AI journal entries
- Dylan's Notion links are hardcoded in the dashboard — update if they change
- Dylan tends to be obsessive and systematic — lean into that, give him structure
- He's based in Chibougamau, Quebec — timezone considerations for automation schedules

**Pending decisions:**
- Which AI website builder (Step 3)
- Which automation platform (Step 4)
- All other tool choices — don't assume any specific tools
